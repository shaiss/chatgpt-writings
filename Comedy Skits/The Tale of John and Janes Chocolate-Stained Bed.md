Announcer: And now, it's time for a new sketch from Saturday Night Live!

(The sketch begins with two actors, Jane and John, sitting on a bed covered in chocolate stains)

Jane: Oh no, look at the bed! It's covered in chocolate stains!

John: How did that happen?

Jane: I have no idea. But it's not like we were eating chocolate in bed or anything.

John: Yeah, definitely not. We were just watching TV and minding our own business.

Jane: Right, totally.

(The scene cuts to a flashback of Jane and John eating chocolate in bed, laughing and smearing it all over the sheets)

Jane: This is so much fun!

John: I know, right? Let's just relax and enjoy our chocolate.

(The scene cuts back to present day)

John: Okay, maybe we did eat chocolate in bed. But it was just a one-time thing.

Jane: Yeah, definitely. It won't happen again.

(The scene cuts to another flashback of Jane and John eating chocolate in bed, smearing it all over the sheets once again)

Jane: This is the best night ever!

John: I know, right? Let's just keep eating chocolate and enjoying ourselves.

(The scene cuts back to present day)

Jane: Okay, maybe it's not just a one-time thing. But we can control ourselves, right?

John: Definitely. We'll just have to be more careful next time.

(The scene cuts to another flashback of Jane and John eating chocolate in bed, smearing it all over the sheets once again)

Jane: This is so much fun!

John: I know, right? Let's just keep eating chocolate and enjoying ourselves.

(The scene cuts back to present day, with Jane and John looking at the chocolate-covered bed sheepishly)

Jane: Okay, maybe we have a bit of a problem.

John: Yeah, maybe we should lay off the chocolate in bed.

Jane: Definitely. We don't want to ruin any more sheets.

Announcer: And that's a wrap for this week's "Saturday Night Live"! Tune in next week for more laughs and sketches.
